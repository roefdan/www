About Me
I hold a university degree with a background in education. However, my technical curiosity eventually outweighed my social skills, leading me to grow professionally in IT. I’ve taught IT courses, installed and managed datacenter (and cloud) infrastructure, led operational teams, built architectures, managed portfolios, innovated, and sold solutions. Technically, virtualization and operational resilience have been the common thread throughout my career. More recently, containerization and observability have joined that list, and I’ve become increasingly interested in the business value of IT.

Applications (and models) have come into focus, shifting my conversations and insights more and more toward the workloads of our companies. Combine all of this with the financial impact of Broadcom’s business model on the budgets of many companies and organizations, and the unexpected momentum it creates to question long-standing practices — I’m eager to help anyone explore and execute those opportunities.

In one of my recent advisory services — inspired by the work of Red Hat and further developed within NTT Data Belgium — I’ve been able to combine all my knowledge and experience with recent insights to help customers (potentially) migrate to another platform. We call this the Virtual Migration Assessment.
